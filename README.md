Bug reports are also welcome as GitHub Issues — but Discord gets the fastest answer.

## 🛡 Antivirus notice (please read — it's a false positive)
**Yes, Windows Defender or VirusTotal may flag this app. No, it's not a virus.** I'm one person trying to help people speed up their PCs — there is nothing malicious in here, and you don't have to take my word for it:

- **The entire source code is right here on GitHub.** Every PowerShell command, every registry value — read it all before you run anything.
- **Why it flags:** this app legitimately does things that *look* like malware to heuristics — launching PowerShell, editing the registry, disabling services, editing the hosts file. Every PC optimizer and sysadmin tool on earth trips the same heuristics.
- **What it never does:** no passwords or personal data leave your PC, no crypto miners, no backdoors, no autostart entries, no nagging. The only internet it uses is the license check (plus font loading). It even ships with an uninstaller.
- **What to do:** on SmartScreen click *More info → Run anyway*. If Defender quarantines it, restore it and add an exclusion — then compare what it does against the source here.

If anything ever behaves unexpectedly, open an Issue and I'll answer it publicly.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version.

2. Add **chrome.bright** on Discord — send your receipt **plus the tier name** (BASE / PRO / EXTREME)
3. You'll receive a one-time code for that tier — paste it in Settings → Activate

Each code is single-use and deleted after activation. Upgrades never demote: a Pro code on an Extreme account changes nothing.

## 🛠 Build from source

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ (Electron 33).

```powershell
cd electron
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd start        # run the app
npm.cmd run build    # → electron/dist/TidalTweaks Setup X.Y.Z.exe
```

> `npm` may be blocked by PowerShell's execution policy — use `npm.cmd`, or run
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`.

## 📁 Project layout

```
electron/
  main.js            # window, IPC, tweak registry, license flow
  preload.js         # sandboxed window.api bridge (renderer has no Node)
  renderer/          # index.html, styles.css, app.js, tabs/*.js
  core/              # tweak engines (cpu/gpu/network/privacy/…), backups, users
  assets/            # icon.ico / icon.png
  scripts/           # afterPack (icon stamp for the installer)
```

## 🧩 Custom presets (local-only, never synced)

Power users can add private stacks in `<userData>/custom-presets.json`
(next to `users.json` in Electron's app-data folder) — same shape as built-ins
(`id`, `title`, `desc`, `warn`, `os`, `ids[]`, `games[]`). They merge into the
Presets tab with a CUSTOM badge, get one restore point + one undo like everything
else, and are tiered by their contents. Malformed entries are skipped silently,
so a typo can never break the built-in list. This file is yours alone: it is
not in git, not in the installer, not synced anywhere.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Tweaks modify Windows. TidalTweaks creates restore points and backups automatically, but you apply tweaks at your own risk — read each confirmation dialog (especially HPET, Secure Boot, and boot-config tweaks) before applying.
